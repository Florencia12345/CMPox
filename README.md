**CMPox** is a project focused on the fundamental calculations in X-ray and neutron scattering, specifically related to attenuation factors, Curie-Weiss analysis, structure factors, and X-ray computations.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **Attenuation factor**: Contains scripts and calculations related to the attenuation factor.
  - `factor.py`: Script for calculating the attenuation factor.
  
- **Curie-Weiss Analysis**: Contains scripts and data for performing Curie-Weiss analysis.
  - `plotdat.py`: Script for plotting data related to the Curie-Weiss law.

- **Structure factor**: Includes files related to the computation of structure factors.

- **Xray**: Contains resources and scripts for X-ray analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can install any required packages using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Usage

Each directory contains specific scripts to perform calculations related to the project:

1. **Attenuation factor**:
   - Navigate to the `Attenuation factor` directory and run `factor.py`:
     ```bash
     python factor.py
     ```

2. **Curie-Weiss Analysis**:
   - Navigate to the `Curie-Weiss Analysis` directory and run `plotdat.py`:
     ```bash
     python plotdat.py
     ```

3. **Structure factor**:
   - Contains X-ray-related computations.
   - Further instructions on usage will be provided in the respective scripts.

4. **Xray**:
   - Additional resources for X-ray analysis are included here.
