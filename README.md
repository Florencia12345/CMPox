**CMPox** is a project focused on the fundamental calculations in X-ray and neutron scattering, specifically related to attenuation factors, Curie-Weiss analysis, structure factors, and X-ray computations.

## Project Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

- **Attenuation factor**: Contains scripts and calculations related to the attenuation factor.
  - `factor.py`: Script for calculating the attenuation factor.
  
- **Curie-Weiss Analysis**: Contains scripts and data for performing Curie-Weiss analysis.
  - `plotdat.py`: Script for plotting data related to the Curie-Weiss law.

- **Structure factor**: Includes files related to the computation of structure factors.

- **Xray**: Contains resources and scripts for X-ray analysis.

## Getting Started
